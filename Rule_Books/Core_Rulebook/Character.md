## Character creation

<!-- I need to clarify how increases work and probably tag them better in actual documents. That way players won't get confused what and by how much they should increase -->

For character creation you need to follow 4 simple steps. You begin with all stats at -2.

1. Choose your **BIRTRIGHT** and select two (2) of the available stat boosts.
2. Choose your **LEGACY** and select two (2) of the available stat boosts.
3. Choose your **DESTINY** and select two (2) of the available stat boosts. You become trained in these two Gate checks.
4. Choose your **CONSTALATION**. Constalation increases one (1) stat left at the base value (-2) by two (2) or increases two (2) stats left at the base value (-2) by one (1)

*Optional Rule:*  
Versetile child: Whenever you get two (2) or more selectable increases and a static increase you can swap it with one of the optional ones.

*Optional Rule*
Heroic: You start character creation with all stats at -1 instead of -2 but you don't get Constelation boost.
