# Characters

## Character creation

For character creation you need to follow 3 simple steps. You begin with all stats at -1. In each step you can boost specific stat **ONLY ONCE**

1. Choose your **BIRTRIGHT** and select one (1) of the available stat boosts (you recieve static boost for "free")
2. Choose your **LEGACY** and select two (2) of the available stat boosts.
3. Choose your **DESTINY** (class) and select one (1) of the available boosts (you recieve static boost for "free"). You become trained in these two Gate checks.

*Optional Rule:*  
Whenever you get two (2) or more selectable increases and a static increase you can swap it with one of the optional ones.
