# Resting

We have three types of rests. From shortest to longest:  
1. *Quick recoup*
2. *Night's rest*
3. *Long treatment*

## Quick recoup

This is rest that takes five (5) to ten (10) minutes (maybe fifteen (15)) where characters can take a breather, take care of their wounds and prepare for what is to come. You will usually do this after each combat.  
While on *Quick recoup* you can gain one (1) stress point in exchange for healing one (1) *Wound* and you can do this however many times you want while in *Quick recoup*.

## Night's rest

Party creates a camp or finds an inn to sleep in where they will have a hearty meal, good night's sleep, and preprare whatever they need for the following day. *Night's rest* lasts for at least eight (8) hours without disturbances or nine (9) hours if there are some short disturbances. It can last for up to twenty four (24) hours. Party can take only one *Night's rest* in twenty four (24) hour period and there needs to be at least twelve (12) hours between two of them.  
While in *Night's rest* you gain level amount tokens. Each token can be exchanged for healing either one (1) *Wound* or one (1) *Stress*. This healing doesn't increase *Stress* if you use it for *Wound*.  
Players regain all features (unless specified otherwise), all tokens, and all spell slots

## Long treatment

Sometimes party will need more time to lick their wounds. In those cases they will need to take longer time off. This will last 2 weeks.  
While they are on *Long treatment* they will heal all their *Wound*s and all their *Stress*. They can also use their time to create something in this free time, but they cannot do any more arduous activities.
