# Gameplay

Every skill check is resolved by rolling two (2) six (6) sided die (2d6) and substracting 2 (this gives us range of 0-10 with Gauss like graph of variability). Exceptions to this rule are advantage where you roll 3d6 and take higher 2 and disadvantage where you roll 3d6 and take lower 2. It is rool under system, where default success is to roll 5 or under, with player modifiers being able to increase range of this possibility.  
Also important is that this system is GM light, where GM can and should put all his energy into telling stories (either trough combat or social interactions) without having to slow down to roll. This is why all rolls are made by the player.  

## Combat actions

Combat action are any actions player can preform while in combat. Each player can preform 3 combat actions per turn.

### Moving (Move action)

Players can use their action to move up to their mobility. Each time player uses this in one turn they reduce their mobility by one (for this turn). Leftover movement from one action cannot be transfered to next one since each action gets resolved by itself.

### Making an attack (Attack action)

Player rolls skill check against their skill gate for attack action (Strength gate). If they succeed they then roll their weapon's damage that DM then substracts from target's life (after applying armor reduction to it).  
In case of Critical skill all weapon's damage die are maxed and then rolled another time.  
Each attack action after the first one in a turn has reduced chances of hitting enemy. This means that each attack after first one in a turn gets stacking Gate penalty of two (-2)

Base Strength gate of multiple attacks:  
| Attack number (in a turn) | Strength gate |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 5 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 1 |
| 4 | -1 |

### Getting attacked (Dodge action)

When player gets attacked by normal enemy attack player rolls skill check against their skill gate for dodge action (Agility gate). If they succeed they take no damage. If they fail they reduce enemy's damage by their armor reduction and take remaining damage.  
In case of Catastrophic skill players don't reduce damage by their armor reduction.  
Each attack action after the first one in a turn has reduced chances of hitting enemy. This means that each attack after first one in a turn gets stacking Gate penalty of two (-2)  
In case of Critical skill player doesn't gain Gate penalty.

Base Agility gate of multiple dodges:  
| Dodge number (in a turn) | Agility gate |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 5 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 1 |
| ... | ... |

### Casting spell (Cast action)

When using spell it will specify which kind od skill gate we should use if any apply.

### Saving against spell (Spell resist action)

When player get's targeted by enemy spell they need to make skill check based on requested stat or skill. The spell itself dictates what each type of outcome of this check means for the creature.
