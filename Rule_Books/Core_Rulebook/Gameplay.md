# Gameplay

Every *Skill test* is resolved by rolling two (2) six (6) sided die (2d6) and substracting two (2) (this gives us range of 0-10 with Gauss like graph of variability). Exceptions to this rule are *Positive test* where you roll 3d6 and take lower 2 and *Negative test* where you roll 3d6 and take higher 2. It is roll under system, where default success is to roll five (5) or under, with player modifiers being able to increase range of this possibility.  
Also important is that this system is GM light, where GM can and should put all his energy into telling stories (either trough combat or social interactions) without having to slow down to roll. This is why all rolls are made by the player.  

## Combat actions

Combat action are any actions player can preform while in combat. Each player gainst three (3) *Action token*s at the start of their turn that they can use however they want.

### Moving (Move action)

Players can use their action to move up to their mobility. Each time player uses this in one turn they reduce their mobility by one (for this turn). Leftover movement from one action cannot be transfered to next one since each action gets resolved by itself.

### Long move (Dash action)

You can use 2 of your actions to preform long move which is equal to 2x your mobility plus one (1) (mobility x 2 + 1) but it must be used all at once.

### Making an attack (Attack action)

Player rolls *Attack test*. If they succeed they then roll their weapon's damage and if that is higher than monster's *Armor reduction* GM increases target's *Wound*s by specified amount.  
In case of *Critical test* target takes *Wound*s as if we successfully passed *Armor reduction*. If we then successfully pass test against *Armor reduction* they take all the damage again.   
Each *Attack test* after the first one in a turn has reduced chances of hitting enemy. This meains player needs to increase *Offensive penalty*.

Base *Attack test* of multiple attacks:  
| Attack number (in a turn) | *Attack target* |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 5 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 1 |
| 4 | -1 |

### Preparing for next turn (Overwatch action)

You can burn one of your *Action tokens* to gain *Positive test* on all *Dodge test*s until your next turn.

### Using item (Interaction action) 

You can use your *Action token* to also interact with any object close enough to you or in your inventory. For some items GM may call for *Skill test*.

### Guarding (Raise shield action)

If you are at least *Trained* in shields you can use your *Action token* to raise the shield and brace for impact. All attack untill your next turn will have to get trough it to deal you damage. This functions as additional *Armor reduction*. If you take damage and you need to do *Guard test*. If you fail your shield looses it's effectiveness till the end of an encounter and you cannot use *Guard action* any more. After encounter you can repair it for free.

### Getting attacked (Dodge action)

When player gets attacked by normal enemy attack player rolls *Dodge test*. If they succeed they take no damage. If they fail they roll *Armor reduction* and if it is lower than attacker's damage they take specified amount of *Wound*s.  
In case of Catastrophic gate player automaticly take specified amount of *Wound*s and further specified amount of *Wound*s if they roll *Armor reduction* under enemy damage.   
Each *Dodge test* after the first one in a turn has reduced chances of dodging enemy's hit. This means player needs to increase *Evasive penalty*.  
In case of *Critical test* player doesn't increase Evasive penalty.

Base *Dodge test* of multiple dodges:  
| Dodge number (in a turn) | *Dodge test* |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 5 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 1 |
| ... | ... |

### Casting spell (Cast action)

When using spell it will specify which kind od *Skill test* we should use if any apply and how many *Action token*s it uses.

### Saving against spell (Spell resist action)

When player get's targeted by enemy's spell they need to make *Skill test* based on requested stat or skill. The spell itself dictates what each type of outcome of this check means for the player.
