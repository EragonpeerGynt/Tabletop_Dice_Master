# Gameplay

Every skill check is resolved by rolling two (2) six (6) sided die (2d6) and substracting 2 (this gives us range of 0-10 with Gauss like graph of variability). Exceptions to this rule are advantage where you roll 3d6 and take higher 2 and disadvantage where you roll 3d6 and take lower 2. It is roll under system, where default success is to roll 5 or under, with player modifiers being able to increase range of this possibility.  
Also important is that this system is GM light, where GM can and should put all his energy into telling stories (either trough combat or social interactions) without having to slow down to roll. This is why all rolls are made by the player.  

## Combat actions

Combat action are any actions player can preform while in combat. Each player can preform 3 combat actions per turn.

### Moving (Move action)

Players can use their action to move up to their mobility. Each time player uses this in one turn they reduce their mobility by one (for this turn). Leftover movement from one action cannot be transfered to next one since each action gets resolved by itself.

### Long move (Dash action)

You can use 2 of your actions to preform long move which is equal to 2x your mobility x 2 + 1 but it must be used all at once.

### Making an attack (Attack action)

Player rolls skill check against their skill gate for attack action (Attack gate). If they succeed they then roll their weapon's damage and if that is higher than target's armor reduction GM increases target's wounds by one (1).  
In case of Critical gate target takes one (1) wound even if damage doesn't penetrate Armor reduction (and further one (1) if it does penetrate Armor reduction)   
Each attack action after the first one in a turn has reduced chances of hitting enemy. This means that each attack after first one in a turn gets stacking Gate penalty of two (-2)

Base Strength gate of multiple attacks:  
| Attack number (in a turn) | Attack gate |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 5 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 1 |
| 4 | -1 |

### Preparing for next turn (Overwatch action)

You can burn one of your actions to gain Gate tyranny on all Dodge actions untill your next turn.

### Using item (Interaction action) 

You can use your action to also interact with any object close enough to you or in your inventory. For some items GM may call for Skill gate.

### Guarding (Raise shield action)

If you are at least trained in shields you can use your action to raise the shield and brace for impact. All attack untill your next turn will have to get trough it to deal you damage. You increase your damage reduction by your shield's value, but if you still take damage you need to throw guard gate. if you fail your shield looses it's effectiveness till the end of encounter and you cannot use guard action any more. After encounter you can repair it for free.

### Getting attacked (Dodge action)

When player gets attacked by normal enemy attack player rolls skill check against their skill gate for dodge action (Dodge gate). If they succeed they take no damage. If they fail they roll Armor reduction and if it is lower than attacker's damage they take one (1) wound.  
In case of Catastrophic gate player automaticly takes one (1) wound and further one if they roll Armor reduction under enemy damage.   
Each attack action after the first one in a turn has reduced chances of hitting enemy. This means that each attack after first one in a turn gets stacking Gate penalty of two (-2)  
In case of Critical skill player doesn't gain Gate penalty.

Base Agility gate of multiple dodges:  
| Dodge number (in a turn) | Dodge gate |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 5 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 1 |
| ... | ... |

### Casting spell (Cast action)

When using spell it will specify which kind od skill gate we should use if any apply.

### Saving against spell (Spell resist action)

When player get's targeted by enemy spell they need to make skill check based on requested stat or skill. The spell itself dictates what each type of outcome of this check means for the creature.
