## Level 1

Improvised granades: Special action that costs one (1) *Action token*. When you use it you produce single alchemical granade. Alchemical granade counts as *Simple weapon* that has Agile and Thrown modifiers without any of their Detriments. Whenever you deal wound to the enemy with alchemical granade you deal additional Flux damage.

Spell preparation: Whenever you gain level in this *Destiny* you can forget one spell known and gain as many spells from Arcane spell list as required to reach Spells known limit. They must be of a level you are capable of casting. You regain all expanded spell slots while you sleep.

## Level 5

You become *Expert* in *Attack test* for *Simple weapon*s and any *Thrown weapon*s.  
You become *Expert* in *Light armor*.  
You become *Expert* in *Arcane (INT) Spell test*.  
You become *Expert* in *Skill test* for INT and AGI.

## Level 8

You become *Specialized* in *Attack test* for any *Thrown weapon*s.  
You become *Specialized* in *Skill test* for AGI.  
You become *Expert* in *Skill test* for CON and WIL.  

## Level 10

Quick thinking: your improvised granades action no longer costs *Action token*. You add INT for each flux damage die and if you hit enemy you deal additional INT wounds to it (min 1).
