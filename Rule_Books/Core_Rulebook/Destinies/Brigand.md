## Level 1

Accurate strike: once per turn when enemy isn't giving your attack their full attention you can use one additional *Action token* to find hole in their defense and strike at it.  
You deal wounds equal to your Accurate strike value if you make *Accurate strike test*.  
Most common exmples of target not giving you attention are Positive test on Attack action or if there's a nerby ally (in melee range of the target). This can also be granted by GM in special situations.  
If dual wielding and you used *Accurate strike* after first attack you can use free attack of dual wield instead of full action.  
You can preform one (1) Accurate strike per turn (but more per round).

Skill training (feature) gives you INT tokens (min 1) to use on skill increases
