## Level 1

Spell preparation: Whenever you gain level in this *Destiny* you can forget one spell known and gain as many spells from Occult spell list as required to reach Spells known limit. They must be of a level you are capable of casting. You regain all expanded spell slots after your morning sacrifice.

Spells known limit: WIL * 2 + Level / 3 (min 1)

Minionmancy: you are capable of summuning minions to your aid that will help you in battle. You have multiple action connected to this skill. Each minion you have on battlefield adds one (1) *Action token* to your turn up to a maximum of 2.

Spirit philactery: small storage used to collect and store souls of the dead. Each soul captured gives one (1) soul up to a maximum of Soul capacity. You can only capture intelegent, sentient souls from (recently) living creatures.

Collect soul action: when somebody dies on the battlefield they gain status Spirited 2. While they have this status you can collect their soul with your action if they are in your melee range.

Summon action: you use your action, appropriate number of souls from your Spirit philactery, and sacrificial life force of one of your allies or yourself. This gives target (even yourself) one (1) *Stress*. After this you create your minion on the field in your melee range.  
This action can only be used once (1) per turn.

| Spirit type | Soul cost | Weapon type | Armor type | Special | Mobility | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Striker | 2 | War + Ranged | Light | Attacks count as spell casting | 4 | Spirit meant to be used as damage support. They aren't very durable but they can lay down quite some pain |
| Shorn | 1 | Status | Half | Mage slayer feat | 5 | Shock unit Spirits meant for offensive. They are quite a bit more durable than Strikers and can survive in hostile backline |
| Guardian | 2 | Simple | Full | Bouncer, Phalanx, and Call to arms feats | 5 | Personal guardian Spirits of Spirit callers. They aren't best at attacking but they have tools to protect their owner and their allies from harm |

Their *Attack test* is same as your *Occult (WIL) Spell test* and it uses your Offensive penalty.  
All their Stats are zero (0) and they are *Expert* in *Dodge test*.  
Spirits are not stable and the souls used to raise them dissipate after combat.

If you have no souls stored in your Spirit philactery at the end of your morning sacrifice you gain one (1) soul.
