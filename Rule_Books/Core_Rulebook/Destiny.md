<!-- ## Necromancer/Minionmancer
the idea is class that can controll multiple (as many as possible) minions while still keeping action economy clean and doesn't create too much book keeping.  

Probably gonna make something between true minionmancer and summoner from PF2 cross-breed with 5e Warlock  
Maybe something in direction of Spirit caller?
