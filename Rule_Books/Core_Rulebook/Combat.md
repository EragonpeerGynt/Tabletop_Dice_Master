# Combat

In combat we have 3 types of timing slices.  
1. **Round**: Time required for all entities in combat to take turn.
2. **Turn**: Time required for one entity to make all it's actions.
3. **Action**: Most basic unit of time in combat. You can do only one thing no matter how simple per action (some things require more than one action)

## Your turn

On your turn you will (usually) gain three (3) action tokens. You can use action token to make any action. There are some exceptions with spells and feats where some actions might cost multiple action tokens

Possible actions (GM can add others):  
| Action | Cost | Requires feat |
|---|---|:---:|
| Attack | 1 | &#9744; |
| Overwatch | 1 | &#9744; |
| Move | 1 | &#9744; |
| Interaction | 1 | &#9744; |
| Raise shield | 1 | &#9744; |
| Cast | N/A* | &#9744; |
| Dual wield | 0 | &#9744; |
| Cleave | 2 | &#9745; |
| Trip | 1 | &#9745; |
| All out | 1 | &#9745; |
| Disarm | 2 | &#9745; |

\* N/A (not applicable) because each spell defines it's own action cost.

Each time you take offensive action your Gate penalty will progress by one step. It begins at 0 and each offensive action lowers it (making it harder for you to succeed in following gates). This Gate penalty get's reset at the end of your turn

## Your actions outside your turn

You can preform Coup De Grace actions granted by features and feats even when it's not your turn. To use them enemy must trigger condition for triggering it after which you decide if you want to use it or not. You can use only one Coup De Grace action per turn.

## Reactions to enemies

When it's enemy's turn they will usually use actions tha effect you. When this happens you will need to use Appropriate skill gate to defend against them.

Posible actions (GM can add others):
| Action | Requires feat |
|---|:---:|
| Dodge | &#9744; |
| Spell resist | &#9744; |
| Call to arms | &#9745; |

Each time you take evasive and/or defensive action your Gate penalty will progress by one step. It begins at 0 and each evasive and/or defensive action lowers it (making it harder for you to succeed in following gates). This Gate penalty get's reset at the start of your turn.
