# Wounds (Vitality)

Each character can only sustain some harm before they become ineffective in combat. This is represented by *Wound*s. Each time character is hit trough *Armor reduction* they gain one *Wound*.  

Maximum number of *Wound*s character can have is called *Vitality* and is based on *Birthright* and *Destiny* type.

## Healing wounds (Durability)

There are multiple ways of healing *Wound*s like spells and potions but they all come at the price. Characters can still feel the pain of a *Wound* even after it has been healed. Character can resist this pain for only so long. Amount they can resist is called *Durability* while current pain is meassured in *Stress*. Whenever you remove one *Wound* you gain one (1) *Stress*.

## How to use

Players track their *Wound*s and their *Stress*.  
When player reaches *Vitality* in *Wound*s they gain *Last stand* status.  
When they have both reached *Vitality* in *Wound*s and reached *Durability* in *Stress* they permanently die without save and possibility of ressurection.

# Potions

There are multiple potions you can use to heal yourself or your allies. These are:

| Name | Quality | Healing |
|---|---|---|
| Lesser wounds | 1 | 1 *Wound* |
| Moderate wounds | 2 | 3 *Wound*s |
| Greater wounds | 3 | 5 *Wound*s |
| Ultimate wounds | 5 | 10 *Wound*s |
| Spirit shot | 1 | 1 *Stress* |
| Calming shot | 2 | 3 *Stress* |
| Tranquilizing shot | 3 | 5 *Stress* |

Each time you dring potion you throw Alchemy or Poison test (whichever is higher) to determine if you become poisoned by potion. If you fail the test you gain *Stress* equal to potion quality and you gain Alchemy reflux status.
