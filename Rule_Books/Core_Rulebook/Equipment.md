# Equipment

Each player has Carry capacity (how much weight they can carry while still being effective in combat) of ther Strength stat + five (5). Weapon weight is calculated as Weapon weight + number of applied modifiers and Armor weight is calculated as Armor weight + number of applied modifiers. These two numbers together need to be below or equal Carry capacity

## Weapons

To use weapon effectively you need to be proficient in their use. Characters can be proficient in all weapons of specific die count, only specialize in one specific modifier, or combination of both.

Weapons categories:
| Weapon type | Weapon base damage | Weapon weight |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Simple | 1d6 +1 | 1 |
| Status | 2d6 | 2 |
| War | 3d6 - 1 | 3 |

### Weapon modifiers

Players can apply modifiers to their weapons that change how weapon behaves in combat, but they come at a price, making weapon heavier with each one applied.

| Modifier | Effect | Detriment |
|---|---|---|
| Agile | Player can use Agility gate instead of Strength gate when takin attack action with this weapon | Weapon deals one (-1) less damage |
| Two-handed | Adds one (+2) to damage for each base damage die |
| Versetile | Adds one (+2) to damage when Two-handing the weapon |
| Polearm | Can strike foes one (1) map unit farther away | Weapon deals one (-1) less damage |
| Ranged | Weapon gains Agile modifier and can strike targets at range | Weapon looses any damage scaling and deals two (-2) less damage and you cannot use it if somebody is in your melee range |
| Thrown | Weapon can strike targets at half range | Weapon deals one (-1) less damage |
| Light | If wielding light weapon in off-hand you can strike with it once per turn after Attack action with same gate penalty as original attack | Weapon deals one (-1) less damage |

### Calculating weapon damage

When calculating how much damage you did on succesfull Attack action you calculate it as following:  
1. Roll weapon Base damage and apply per dice effects
2. Add any modifiers if they apply
3. Add any runes if they apply
4. Add Strength stat

Minimum damage single dice can provide is one (1) even if you have modifiers that would put dice roll into negatives it stays at 1 damage. This is after all the per dice effects are applied. Modifiers and stats can lower total damage down to zero (0) if they are so low.

## Armor

To use armor effectively you need to be proficient in their use. Characters can be proficient in all armors of specific die count, only specialize in one specific modifier, or combination of both.

Armor categories:  
| Armor type | Armor base reduction | Armor weight |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Cloth | none | 0 |
| Light | 1d6 + 1 | 1 |
| Half | 2d6 | 2 |
| Full | 3d6 - 1 | 3 |

### Armor modifiers

Players can apply modifiers to their armor that change how armor behaves in combat, but they come at a price, making armor heavier with each one applied.

| Modifier | Effect | Detriment |
|---|---|---|
| Unmovable | Gate penalty on attack get's lower from two (-2) to one (1) | Player takes one (+1) more damage |
| Sturdy | Player takes one (-1) less damage for each base armor die | Player looses one (-1) of their base mobility |

### Calculating damage taken

When calculating how much damage you take on failed Dodge action you calculate is as following:  
1. Roll Armor base reduction
2. Add any modifiers if they apply
3. Add skill level for each Armor base reduction die
4. Add any runes if they apply
5. Lower damage by calculated value and lower your health by remaining ammount

## Shield

Shield is active armor that combatant needs to use in exchange of an action. It temporary boosts your armor reduction but it can break.

There is only one shield type and it has Armor base reduction of 1d6 but they do come in multiple qualities.

### Shield modifiers

| Modifier | Effect | Detriment |
|---|---|---|
| Quick reflexes | You can use your reaction to activate Raise shield action (only for this hit) after you learn that you failed dodge gate but before you know if you have taken any damage. You can use this once per encounter | You need to make Guard gate even if you didn't take any damage |
| Battlefield repairs | Each time your shield takes damage you instead loose one modifier, but you can still use your shield. When you run out of modifiers you cannot use shield anymore |
| Shield redirection | After using Raise shield action and attack not getting trough your armor reduction you can use Coup De Grace against the attacker |

## Runes

Runes are additional customizations for weapons and armor. They can be applied to any high quality weapon or armor (equipment that has +1/+2/+3). Quality doesn't change damage or armor reduction and doesn't change Skill gate. Runes with same name don't stack and you can apply as many runes as the equipment quality.
