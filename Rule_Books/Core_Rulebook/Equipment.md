# Equipment

Each player has Carry capacity (how much weight they can carry while still being effective in combat) of ther Strength stat + five (5). Weapon weight is calculated as Weapon weight + number of applied modifiers and Armor weight is calculated as Armor weight + number of applied modifiers. These two numbers together need to be below or equal Carry capacity
