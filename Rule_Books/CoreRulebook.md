## Gameplay Rules

Every skill check is resolved by rolling two (2) six (6) sided die (2d6) and substracting 2 (this gives us range of 0-10 with Gauss like graph of variability). Exceptions to this rule are advantage where you roll 3d6 and take higher 2 and disadvantage where you roll 3d6 and take lower 2. It is rool under system, where default success is to roll 5 or under, with player modifiers being able to increase range of this possibility.  
Also important is that this system is GM light, where GM can and should put all his energy into telling stories (either trough combat or social interactions) without having to slow down to roll. This is why all rolls are made by the player.  

### Combat actions

Combat action are any actions player can preform while in combat. Each player can preform 3 combat actions per turn.

#### Moving (Move action)

Players can use their action to move up to their mobility. Each time player uses this in one turn they reduce their mobility by one (for this turn). Leftover movement from one action cannot be transfered to next one since each action gets resolved by itself.

#### Making an attack (Attack action)

Player rolls skill check against their skill gate for attack action (Strength gate). If they succeed they then roll their weapon's damage that DM then substracts from target's life (after applying armor reduction to it).  
In case of Critical skill all weapon's damage die are maxed and then rolled another time.  
Each attack action after the first one in a turn has reduced chances of hitting enemy. This means that each attack after first one in a turn gets stacking Gate penalty of two (-2)

Base Strength gate of multiple attacks:  
| Attack number (in a turn) | Strength gate |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 5 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 1 |
| 4 | -1 |

#### Getting attacked (Dodge action)

When player gets attacked by normal enemy attack player rolls skill check against their skill gate for dodge action (Agility gate). If they succeed they take no damage. If they fail they reduce enemy's damage by their armor reduction and take remaining damage.  
In case of Catastrophic skill players don't reduce damage by their armor reduction.  
Each attack action after the first one in a turn has reduced chances of hitting enemy. This means that each attack after first one in a turn gets stacking Gate penalty of two (-2)  
In case of Critical skill player doesn't gain Gate penalty.

Base Agility gate of multiple dodges:  
| Dodge number (in a turn) | Agility gate |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 5 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 1 |
| ... | ... |

#### Casting spell

When using spell it will specify which kind od skill gate we should use if any apply.

#### Saving against spell

When player get's targeted by enemy spell they need to make skill check based on requested stat or skill. The spell itself dictates what each type of outcome of this check means for the creature.

### Equipment

Each player has Carry capacity (how much weight they can carry while still being effective in combat) of ther Strength stat + five (5). Weapon weight is calculated as Weapon weight + number of applied modifiers and Armor weight is calculated as Armor weight + number of applied modifiers. These two numbers together need to be below or equal Carry capacity

### Weapons

To use weapon effectively you need to be proficient in their use. Characters can be proficient in all weapons of specific die count, only specialize in one specific modifier, or combination of both.

Weapons categories:
| Weapon type | Weapon base damage | Weapon weight |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Simple | 1d6 | 1 |
| Status | 2d6 | 2 |
| War | 3d6 | 3 |

#### Weapon modifiers

Players can apply modifiers to their weapons that change how weapon behaves in combat, but they come at a price, making weapon heavier with each one applied.

| Polearm | Can strike foes one (1) map unit farther away | Weapon deals one (-1) less damage |
| Ranged | Weapon gains Agile modifier and can strike targets at range | Weapon looses any damage scaling and deals two (-2) less damage |
| Thrown | Weapon can strike targets at half range | Weapon deals one (-1) less damage |
| Light | If wielding two light weapons you can strike with second one once per turn after Attack action with same gate penalty as original attack | Weapon deals one (-1) less damage |
