## Gameplay Rules

Every skill check is resolved by rolling two (2) six (6) sided die (2d6) and substracting 2 (this gives us range of 0-10 with Gauss like graph of variability). Exceptions to this rule are advantage where you roll 3d6 and take higher 2 and disadvantage where you roll 3d6 and take lower 2. It is rool under system, where default success is to roll 5 or under, with player modifiers being able to increase range of this possibility.  
Also important is that this system is GM light, where GM can and should put all his energy into telling stories (either trough combat or social interactions) without having to slow down to roll. This is why all rolls are made by the player.  

### Combat actions

Combat action are any actions player can preform while in combat.

#### Making an attack

Player rolls skill check against their skill gate for attack action (Strength check). If they succeed they then roll their weapon's damage that DM then substracts from target's life (after applying armor reduction to it).  
In case of critical success all weapon's damage die are maxed and then rolled another time.

#### Getting attacked

When player gets attacked by normal enemy attack player rolls skill check against their skill gate for dodge action (Agility check). If they succeed they take no damage. If they fail they reduce enemy's damage by their armor reduction and take remaining damage. In case of catastrophic skill players don't reduce damage by their armor reduction.

#### Casting spell

#### Saving against spell

When player get's targeted by enemy spell they need to make skill check based on requested stat or skill. The spell itself dictates what each type of outcome of this check means for the creature.

## GM Rules
